# Exercise 4.01

Show the output produced by eah of the following program fragments. Assume that `i`, `j`, and `k` are `int` variables.

(a)

```c
i = 5; j = 3;
printf("%d %d", i / j, i % j);
```

(b)

```c
i = 2; j = 3;
printf("%d", (i + 10) & j);
```

(c)

```c
i = 7; j = 8; k = 9;
printf("%d", (i + 10) % k / j);
```

## Solution

(a) `1 2`\
(b) `0`\
(c) `1`\
