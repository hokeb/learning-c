# Exercise 2.02

Consider the following program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    printf("Parkinson's Law:\nWork expands so as to ");
    printf("fill the time\n");
    printf("available for its completion.\n");
    return 0;
}
```

(a) Identify the directives and statements in this program.

- The only directive is `#include <stdio.h>` because it is a command intended for the  preprocessor

(b) What output does the program produce?

- The program output is:

```txt
Parkinson's Law:
Work expands so as to fill the time
available for it's completion

```
